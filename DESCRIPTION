Description: A collection of useful functions that I have used in various 
  projects and in other R packages. They support some miscellaneous operations 
  on data frames, matrices and vectors, pretty printing of vector names and 
  values in an R notebook, quick saving of data to a file, making a multiple 
  densities plot, etc.
