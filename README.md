A collection of useful functions that I have used in various projects and in 
other R packages. They support some miscellaneous operations on data frames, 
matrices and vectors, pretty printing of vector names and values in an R 
notebook, quick saving of data to a file, making a multiple densities plot, 
etc.

## Install

```
devtools::install_github("bblodfon/usefun")
